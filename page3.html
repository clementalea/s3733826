<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<img src="travel.jpg" >
<p>This is what my ideal job looks like. Not a mountain climber, but a job that will allow me to travel with my friends. This may sound cliche and the same as anyone's idea of the "American Dream", with thoughts of financial success. However, unlike a lot of those people, I do not want the riches for myself. I want to share my happiness with my friends. I want a nice work environment without tension between the employees. I want to be able to support other people. I want to have a fun job where I get to see the world, have enough time for my hobbies and interests, and make a lot of money. My ideal job includes talking to people and not just staying behind the desk all day. It would also be nice to have business trips and to be able to play golf as a from of business meetings with other companies' executives. But most importantly, I just want to enjoy what I'm doing.</p>
<h3>Position</h3>
<img src="job.png" height="400">
<p>This is an example of the position that is appealing to me because it offers a managerial position in a start-up company. A small start-up will usually have smaller workforces than that of large corporations. This means that I can get to know each of my co-worker better. Also, this usually means that there are less conflicts because there are not a lot of people to have conflict with in the frist place and people are usually more understadning towards closer colleagues. It is also interesting to me because I have always wanted to be in a start-up or start my own company because they have a nice and relaxed image instead of a overbearing and tedious image that a large corporation gives off. Also, the pay is not bad and it's in dollars, so I can send my parents more money due to the economy of the dollar being stronger against my home currency.</p>
<h3>Qualifications</h3>
<p>They are looking for someone with strong leadership skills, the ability to review codes, is familiar with MS technologies and the ability to hire new recruits. A strong web or start-up background would be advantageous, the applicant needs to have excellent stakeholder engagement, and have the ability to creat a strong work culture.</p>
<h3>Experience</h3>
<p>I currently fo not have much qualifications yet. That is why I'm going to uni; in order to finish my degree and be more qualified. Experiences that I have includes an internship at an engineering firm during my final year of high-school amongst other things. I am currently looking for a part-time job.</p>
<h3>Future Plan</h3>
<p>I plan to enter a technology company and work for a couple of years to gain the necessary experience. I would like to wokr under someone with a deep understanding of the business and the technologies that are involved. I would learn as much as I can from my seniors and co-workers, not only about the products but also about what it's like to work professionally.</p>
