<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
<h3>Personality Trait</h3>
<img src="personality.png" alt="Personality" height="350" border="1"><img src="Campaigners.png" height="350" border="1">
<p>I remembered taking the test a few years back and if my memory serves me well I would have gotten a ENFP-T back then.
This seems pretty accurate since I retook the same test and got ENFP-A this time. The ENFP part stand for Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting. This part did not change. However, the turbulent trait that I had upon first taking the test was starting to creep slightly towards the other side.
This may be due a certain degree of maturity that I have gained over the course of the past few years. ENFPs are described as being a free spirit and as being "the life of the party". They enjoy and cherish the social and emotional connections that they make with others deeply. ENFPs also has a strategy of people mastery in doing their daily activities, this explains why I enjoy learning new cultures so much.
It is because I feel greatly rewarded by the ability to connect to more people from different backgrounds.</p>
<h3>Learning Style</h3>

<p>Based on the result of an online test, my learning style is: Auditory and Visual. I feel that this is adequately accurate since I can somewhat recall that I have been using flashcards to learn english since pre-school; and even up to high-school I would ask my friends to ask me questions orally during group study sessions in preparation for exams.</p>
<h3>Hogwart's House</h3>

<p>Slytherins are described as being Cunning, Ambitious, Creative and Resourceful. They are always striving to be the best with one inhibiting condition, which is that they will never leave one of their own behind. This may be the reason that Slytherins are not afraid to admit that their house has produced a lot of Dark Witches and Wizards. It might also be the reason that I find it dificult to a fault to leave my friends behind even when they have done something to offend me; and also why I protected my friend from a gang of bullies in primary school eventhough I was largerly outnumbered. The Cunning trait might also explain why I am really good at telling half-truths eventhough I made a promise to myself never to lie to anyone. Also, the Ambitious trait is a pretty good reason as to why I am always stressed out when I see that I am not doing as well as others in a certain field.</p>

<h3>Team Behaviour</h3>
<img src="team.jpg" height="450">
<p>In teams, I don't usually jump the gun to be the leader. However, when there is a need for and a lack of a leader, I usually step in subconsciously. I tend to get a lot of votes as a leader, even from my seniors, even though I do not desire the position itself, especially with all the burdensome and freedom-limiting tasks that comes with such a position. I also find myself in a lot of situations where I am the middleman, this can be explained by the personality trait of ENFPs which oftentimes takes on the role of a diplomat. This also ties in to the way in which I tend to resolve interpersonal problems within a "team" or a society.
My go-to strategy would be to analize the situation calmly from a third-person point of view and try to understand all sides of an argument. However, the Feeling trait in me kicks in to stop me from being an absolute logician and to know in which cases it is okay to bend or break some rules fore the benefit of the better good. This is also backed-up by my Intuition trait since it helps me take an educated guess better in uncalculated situations.</p>
<h3>Forming a Team</h3>
<p>In order for me to perform the best, the team composition should include at least one other leader which could take the spotlight away from me at times when I'm feeling too occupied with work. However, the other leader should not be too headstrong in expressing their opinions because of my Feeling trait. This trait indicates that my mood can swing largely in a small amount of time; and when my mood is bad, I can sometimes choose to stay silent about an issue that is hurting the team eventhough I am aware of the fact and of the solution. There is also a need for a person that is meticulous and consistent, to be present in the team and in a way act as a secretary. This is due to the fact that someone with my personality traits, even though we might provide creativity and energy, tends to work in uncontrolled burst. Therefore, it is the job of the secretary to finish all the tedious jobs that otherwise would have been left to rot and to make sure that everything in accordance with the plan, or even to make sure that the team has a plan to begin with.</p>
