<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>
  This is me. Well, the picture was taken a few years ago before I gained a few kilograms, but yeah it's me.
I'm an international student currently studying Bachelors of Computer Science at RMIT. I'm an Indonesian-born guy with a Chinese heritage. I finished my International Baccalaureate program, which I highly recommend for others to avoid, before I went here to RMIT. In fact, I applied and got accepted into RMIT through my IB grades.</p>

<p>My student email is: s3733826@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

<h3>Languages</h3>

<p>So far, I'm able to speak 3 languages fluently which are: Indonesian, English, and Javanese; an Indonesian dialect that is not to be confused with Java, the programming language, or the Japanese language as Wikipedia would say. I also have the ability to understand a tiny bit (emphasis on tiny) of Mandarin Chinese due to me only being the third generation Indonesian-born in our family and thus having exposure to the previous generations speaking Mandarin to each other, and sometimes to me, at home. I have also studied Korean by myself to the point where I can read and write most words and converse in simple conversations, albeit still having a limited vocabulary. Another language that I am involved in is Japanese, not to be confused with Javanese. I am currently enrolled in the Japanese 1 course that is available in RMIT.</p>

<h3>Favorite Sport</h3>
<img src="bball.jpg" alt="basketball" height="300">
<p>My favorite sport is basketball. The sport runs in my family; my father used to be a basketball player for his high-school team before he switched to swimming during his college years;
my uncle used to be a college player before his knee injury; and my grandfather used to represent his city in inter-state competitions. Personally, I myself have been playing the sport since I was still in primary school, around the age of 8. I fell in love with the game not because of the personal greatness that you can achieve in the sport by doing various things by yourself. Instead, the opposite attracted me.
No matter how good a single player is, he still has to operate as only a single part of a large network, and the best plays in the history of the sport, in my opinion, has to do with a dynamic beauty that emerges from only the best chemistry and teamwork that a squad of 5-men running on hardwood can produce.</p>

<h3>My Pet</h3>

<p>This is my pet dog, she's a really cute beagle named Jasmine. I miss her almost more than I miss my baby brother, definitely more than my other brother. That will be all.</p>
