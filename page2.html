<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>My interest in IT started out during my middle school years where I took an ICT course to meet the minimum requirement of the IGCSE curriculum. At first, I just selected the subject without much deliberation. However, I started liking it when I got my test results back and ICT was my second-best mark. Then it continued to my high school years where I was actually planning to take a computer related subject but the school didn’t have it. I was actually planning to go to engineering in university but it wasn’t because of a major interest or passion in the field. It was just because I was taking science at the time instead of commerce and that’s where most of the science students are going. That is until I met a computer scientist in an Airbnb in Canada when I was checking out the universities there.</p>
<p>The computer scientist talked to me about the major I selected and why I did so. Then, after a few nights of talking with both me and my father, he suggested that I follow suit in his path as a programmer. He negated my previous worries about programming such as sitting behind a desk all day. He explained that a good programmer will think about the current code that they’re working on throughout the day and only do actual coding when they have found out an answer as to how to solve certain problems in the code or has understood how to further progress the code. After this, me and my family took into consideration the possibility of me doing a computer degree.   I have way too much things that I am interested in and thus had a very hard time selecting a major that I want to undertake in university. A computers degree makes sense in this scenario since technology is needed everywhere and so I will have an easier time in selecting a job.</p>

<p>I have always wanted to study abroad, so the options were limitless for me. Therefore, I had to narrow my options down. At first I wanted to go to Japan because the technology is advanced there. However, I do not want to get bad grades in a subject that I understand just because I didn't understand Japanese; and the courses that were taught in Egnlish were mostly business related courses. So, I crossed out countries that I do not know the lanugages to. Then came the part to choose the actual university. I was asking colleagues and surfing online to find a good university that focuses on technology. I set my eyes on English speaking countries with good universities including: U.S.A., Canada, and Australia. My parents didn't want me to go too far though, and since RMIT checks all the boxes, I decided to continue my studies here.</p>
<p>I expect to learn a lot pf things here, and not just limited to the classroom. I was never that academic to begin with. I just saw grades as something that you need to fulfill in order to get to the next step in life instead of something that you must devote your whole life into getting it perfect. So, I expect to learn a lot about IT because, in the end, that's my major after all. However, I'm also looking to improve other parts of my life such as my English.</p>
